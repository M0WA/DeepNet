      <h4>About DeepNet</h4>
      <p>
      DeepNet is a complete set of open source applications and software libraries 
      to do datamining and indexing tasks of websites. Therefore it is a multi purpose
      search engine.

      <h4>Goals</h4>
      <p>
      One of our main goals is to make it as easy as possible for everybody
      to operate a search engine. This does not only inhibit an easy censorship like
      it is be possible today with a central database, it also conducts to a wider
      diversity and redundancy of information available to be found on the internet.
      Secondly it prevents the corruption of search results i.e. by commercials and
      paid results. This is also a common occurance on todays search engines.
      Of course there are a lot more advantages for operating a search engine, but these
      two are the ones that are most important to us.
