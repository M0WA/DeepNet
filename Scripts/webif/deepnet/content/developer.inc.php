      DeepNet is mainly written in C++. It is separated into a set of statically linked libraries and a few executables.
      The C++ code is documented using doxygen so it should be easy to get into the source code. It is developed using
      eclipse IDE which I encourage you to use when compiling and developing DeepNet.
      </p>

      There is a <a href=\"doxygen/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">doxygen documentation</a> available online.
